This README.md contains a high level description of the implementation specifics of our amazing project. There are Four Main Parts which will be explored in depth: 

	(1) AMStartup.c 
	(2) avatar.c 
	(3) graphics.c 
	(4) mazeSolver.c

Each of the above will be explained through detailed pseudocode, descriptions of abstract data structures, definitions of APIs / interfaces / function / prototypes and parameters, and error handling + recovery. 


### Overview of Application

Our maze-solving application simulates players (i.e. avatars) searching for each other in a maze generated and managed by a server application. A random maze of certain dimensions is generated by the server, and the caller determines the number of avatars and the difficulty of the game. The avatars will move around and discover the maze. The game ends when all players converge at one common point.

### User interface

The maze solver’s only interface with the user is on the command-line; it must always be provided 3 arguments, like in the following example: 

```
./AMStartup -n <NUM_OF_AVATARS> -d <DIFFICULTY_LEVEL> -h <HOST_NAME>
```
e.g. ./AMStartup -n 3 -d 3 -h flume.cs.dartmouth.edu


## Detailed parameter description + pseudocode for objects/components/functions:

### AMStartup.c:

**Parameters:**

**Pseudocode**

	1. Validate command line arguments 
	2. Create/connect socket to server 
	3. Send init message w/ diff. & numAvatars from passed args
	4. Receive response from server,
	5. If we've received an error, exit.
	6. If we receive INIT_OK message, 
	7. Create maze, log file, mutex_lock, avatars, and all shared values & create 'numAvatars' threads, passing in above values via a startupStruct
	8. Join threads to main thread and wait until they're done
	9. When the threads return, delete avatars, logfile string, maze, socket, & exit main process with code 0.

	14. If currentAvatar hasn't received "new" coordinates & thus hasn't moved, 
	15. if currentAvatar's direction is not 8 & therefore should still be adding walls, add a wall & re-orient the avatar to where it was facing before the failed move attempt.
	16. Re-draw the maze
	17. If our coordinates are not the same, the move was a success, and we must re-draw the maze and update currentAvatar's positions to the new coordinates.

### mazeSolver.c

Contains only helper functions which are called within avatar.c. If there are any errors in allocating memory for the data structures, corresponding error messages will be outputted. 

### graphics.c: 

Contains only helper functions which are called within avatar.c. If there are any errors in allocating memory for the data structures, corresponding error messages will be outputted. 

Note: The functions of graphics.c and mazeSolver are not affected by user input. As such, there are no exit-code error cases to be handled. 


## Memory-Related Issues

- To test for memory leaks, run valgrind. 

- Notice that resulted memory leaks are caused by the <curses.h> library. Example shown below. 

e.g. 

```
 3,904 bytes in 1 blocks are still reachable in loss record 33 of 37
==620454==    at 0x483980B: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:309)
==620454==    by 0x48EEF3F: ??? (in /usr/lib64/libtinfo.so.6.1)
==620454==    by 0x48F3BAB: _nc_setupterm (in /usr/lib64/libtinfo.so.6.1)
==620454==    by 0x48C70EC: newterm_sp (in /usr/lib64/libncurses.so.6.1)
==620454==    by 0x48C759C: newterm (in /usr/lib64/libncurses.so.6.1)
==620454==    by 0x48C35CF: initscr (in /usr/lib64/libncurses.so.6.1)		# curses.h throwing errors
==620454==    by 0x402996: main (AMStartup.c:180)
```

From internet research and TA consulting, we find that the memory errors raised by curses are not caused by our own data structures and implementation. Rather, they are harmless, raised by initscr(). 

- Notice that resulted memory errors are caused by <pthread.h>. Example shown below. 

``` 
Thread 3:

==591127== Syscall param socketcall.sendto(msg) points to uninitialised byte(s)
==591127==    at 0x48A3C8C: __libc_send (send.c:28)
==591127==    by 0x48A3C8C: send (send.c:23)
==591127==    by 0x402C90: runAvatar (avatar.c:483)
==591127==    by 0x48994E1: start_thread (pthread_create.c:479)
==591127==    by 0x4A106D2: clone (clone.S:95)

```

- To verify that the data structures and functions we implemented do not generate any leaks or errors, comment out any curse-related functions. These include: 

```c 
# creating a window instance
WINDOW *window;

# initialising the screen
if ((mainwindow = initscr())== NULL){
    printf("failed to initialise screen\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

# drawing the maze
drawMaze(getHeight(initStruct), getWidth(initStruct), getNumAvatars(initStruct), avatars, maze);

# deleting the window
delwin(mainwindow);

# ending the window
endwin()
```

Here is an example of when the functions above are commented out:


```
[lucalit888@flume ~/project-maze-challenge-bing]$ valgrind ./AMStartup -h flume.cs.dartmouth.edu -d 2 -n 2
	.
	.
	.
==591127== HEAP SUMMARY:
==591127==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==591127==   total heap usage: 262 allocs, 262 frees, 59,950 bytes allocated
==591127== 
==591127== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
```


To build, run `make`.

To clean up, run `make clean`.
